    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a data scientist or engineer working at a company that is building an AI application that helps healthcare providers manage their patient communication data. Examples could include an application that creates summaries of conversations, one that analyzes the conversations and classifies them by type, or even the chatbot itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for you to create this application, you'll need some examples to make sure it works well and efficiently. But you quickly realized it might be tough to get access to a good dataset of patient communication messages to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll show you how you can use Memex to generate a synthetic set of patient communications. We'll explore how to pre-process data, utilize Memex's capabilities to query and transform data, and finally, how to synthesize patient communications using Memex's unique integration of User-Defined Functions (UDFs) with SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll start with detailed medical records as inputs, and end with relevant patient communications through the following workflow:\n",

    "_Patient detailed medical records -> formatted patient medical histories -> summarized medical histories -> Patient messages to a healthcare provider_\n",
